## Flutter Basics: Widget Tree & Reactive UI

StatelessWidget is for static UI, StatefulWidget updates dynamically with state changes. Flutter builds UIs using a widget tree, re-rendering only changed parts for efficiency. Dart is ideal for Flutter with object-oriented, null-safe, and async-friendly features. Demo app: Counter App updates instantly with Hot Reload. 
Screenshots show UI on Android/iOS.
