## Flutter Basics: Widget Tree & Reactive UI

StatelessWidget is for static UI, StatefulWidget updates dynamically with state changes. Flutter builds UIs using a widget tree, re-rendering only changed parts for efficiency. Dart is ideal for Flutter with object-oriented, null-safe, and async-friendly features. Demo app: Counter App updates instantly with Hot Reload. 
Screenshots show UI on Android/iOS.

## Flutter Folder Structure 

main.dart – App entry point.

screens/ – App pages (UI screens).

widgets/ – Reusable components.

models/ – Data structures.

services/ – API/Firebase logic.

This structure keeps UI, logic, and data separate, making the app modular and scalable.
Files use snake_case, classes/widgets use PascalCase, and variables use camelCase.
